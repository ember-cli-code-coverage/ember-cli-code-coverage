# ember-cli-code-coverage [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kategengler/ember-cli-code-coverage.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kategengler/ember-cli-code-coverage)

Code coverage using [Istanbul](https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul) for Ember apps.

## Requirements
* If using Mocha, Testem `>= 1.6.0` for which you need ember-cli `> 2.4.3`
* If using Mirage you need `ember-cli-mirage >= 0.1.13`
* If using Pretender you need `pretender >= 0.11.0`


## Installation

* `ember install ember-cli-code-coverage`

## Usage

Coverage will only be generated when an environment variable is true (by default `COVERAGE`) and running your test command like normal.

For example:

`COVERAGE=true ember test`

## Configuration

Configuration is optional. It should be put in a file at `config/coverage-config.js`.

#### Options

- `coverageEnvVar`: Defaults to `COVERAGE`. This is the environment variable that when set will cause coverage metrics to be generated.

- `reporters`: Defaults to `['lcov', 'html']`. The `json-summary` reporter will be added to anything set here, it is required. This can be any [reporters supported by Istanbul](https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul/tree/master/lib/report).

- `excludes`: Defaults to `['*/mirage/**/*']`. An array of globs to exclude from instrumentation. Useful to exclude files from coverage statistics.

- `coverageFolder`: Defaults to `coverage`. A folder relative to the root of your project to store coverage results.

## Using when intercepting all ajax requests in tests

Aka when using ember-cli-mirage or Pretender. You may require a version of Pretender that includes [this fix](https://github.com/pretenderjs/pretender/pull/130).

To work, this addon has to post coverage results back to a middleware at `/write-coverage`.

```
// in mirage/config.js

  this.passthrough('/write-coverage');
  this.namespace = 'api';  // It's important that the passthrough for coverage is before the namespace, otherwise it will be prefixed.
```

## Inspiration

This addon was inspired by [`ember-cli-blanket`](https://github.com/sglanzer/ember-cli-blanket).
The primary differences are that this addon uses Istanbul rather than Blanket for coverage and it instruments your application code as part of the build, when enabled.
