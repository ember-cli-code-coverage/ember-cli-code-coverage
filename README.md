# ember-cli-code-coverage

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/ember-cli-code-coverage.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/ember-cli-code-coverage)
[![CI](https://github.com/kategengler/ember-cli-code-coverage/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/kategengler/ember-cli-code-coverage/actions?query=workflow%3ACI)

Code coverage using [Istanbul](https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul) for Ember apps.

## Requirements
* If using Mocha, Testem `>= 1.6.0` for which you need ember-cli `> 2.4.3`
* If using Mirage you need `ember-cli-mirage >= 0.1.13`
* If using Pretender (even as a dependency of Mirage) you need `pretender >= 0.11.0`
* If using Mirage or Pretender, you need to [set up a passthrough for coverage to be written](#create-a-passthrough-when-intercepting-all-ajax-requests-in-tests).
* `ember-cli-babel >= 6.0.0`


## Installation

* `ember install ember-cli-code-coverage`

## Setup

In order to gather code coverage information, you must first install the Babel plugins in each project that you'd like to have instrumented.

For classic apps (ember-cli-build.js):

```js
let app = new EmberApp(defaults, {
  babel: {
    plugins: [...require('ember-cli-code-coverage').buildBabelPlugin()],
  },
});
```

For embroider apps (ember-cli-build.js):

```js
let app = new EmberApp(defaults, {
  babel: {
    plugins: [...require('ember-cli-code-coverage').buildBabelPlugin({ embroider: true })],
  },
});
```

For in-repo addons (index.js):

```js
module.exports = {
  name: require('./package').name,

  options: {
    babel: {
      plugins: [...require('ember-cli-code-coverage').buildBabelPlugin()],
    },
  },
};
```

For in-repo engines (index.js):

```js
module.exports = EngineAddon.extend({
  // ...
  included() {
    this._super.included.apply(this, arguments);
    this.options.babel.plugins.push(...require('ember-cli-code-coverage').buildBabelPlugin());
  },
});
```

tests/test-helpers.js:
```js
import { forceModulesToBeLoaded, sendCoverage } from 'ember-cli-code-coverage/test-support';
import Qunit from 'qunit';

QUnit.done(async function() {
  forceModulesToBeLoaded();
  await sendCoverage();
});
```

## Usage

Coverage will only be generated when an [environment variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable) is true (by default `COVERAGE`) and running your test command like normal.

For example:

`COVERAGE=true ember test`

If you want your coverage to work on both Unix and Windows, you can do this:

`npm install cross-env --save-dev`

and then:

`cross-env COVERAGE=true ember test`

When running with `parallel` set to true, the final reports can be merged by using `ember coverage-merge`. The final merged output will be stored in the `coverageFolder`.

If you intend to use `ember test` with the `--path` flag, you should generate the build
with `coverageEnvVar` set as true. This is because the code is instrumented for
coverage during the build.

For example:

`COVERAGE=true ember build --environment=test --output-path=dist`

followed by

`COVERAGE=true ember test --path=dist`

## TypeScript integration

Steps:

* in `tsconfig.json`
```js
  {
    "compilerOptions": {
      "inlineSourceMap": true,
      "inlineSources": true
    }
  }
```
* in `ember-cli-build.js`
```js
  const app = new EmberApp(defaults, {
    babel: {
      sourceMaps: 'inline'
    },
    sourcemaps: {
      enabled: true,
      extensions: ['js']
    }
  });
```
* in `package.json` specify latest available version
```js
  {
    devDependencies: {
      "ember-cli-code-coverage": "^2.1.0",
    }
  }
```
## ember-template-imports integration

* in `ember-cli-build.js
```
  const app = new EmberApp(defaults, {
    'ember-template-imports': {
      inline_source_map: true,
    },
  });
```

## Configuration

Configuration is optional. It should be put in a file at `config/coverage.js` (`configPath` configuration in package.json is honored). In addition to this you can configure Istanbul by adding a `.istanbul.yml` file to the root directory of your app (See https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul#configuring)

#### Options

- `coverageEnvVar`: Defaults to `COVERAGE`. This is the environment variable that when set will cause coverage metrics to be generated.

- `reporters`: Defaults to `['lcov', 'html']`. The `json-summary` reporter will be added to anything set here, it is required. This can be any [reporters supported by Istanbul](https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul/tree/master/lib/report).

- `excludes`: Defaults to `['*/mirage/**/*']`. An array of globs to exclude from instrumentation. Useful to exclude files from coverage statistics.

- `extension`: Defaults to `['.gjs', '.gts', '.js', '.ts', '.cjs', '.mjs', '.mts', '.cts']`. Tell Istanbul to instrument only files with the provided extensions.

- `coverageFolder`: Defaults to `coverage`. A folder relative to the root of your project to store coverage results.

- `parallel`: Defaults to `false`. Should be set to true if parallel testing is being used for separate test runs, for example when using [ember-exam](https://github.com/trentmwillis/ember-exam) with the `--partition` flag. This will generate the coverage reports in directories suffixed with `_<random_string>` to avoid overwriting other threads reports. These reports can be joined by using the `ember coverage-merge` command (potentially as part of the [posttest hook](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts) in your `package.json`).

- `modifyAssetLocation`: Optional function that will allow you to override where a file actually lives inside of your project. See [Advanced customization](#modifyassetlocation) on how to use this function in practice.

#### Example
```js
  module.exports = {
    coverageEnvVar: 'COV'
  }
```

## Create a passthrough when intercepting all ajax requests in tests

To work, this addon has to post coverage results back to a middleware at `/write-coverage`.

If you are using [`ember-cli-mirage`](http://www.ember-cli-mirage.com) you should add the following:

```
// in mirage/config.js

  this.passthrough('/write-coverage');
  this.namespace = 'api';  // It's important that the passthrough for coverage is before the namespace, otherwise it will be prefixed.
```

If you are using [`ember-cli-pretender`](https://github.com/rwjblue/ember-cli-pretender) you should add the following:

```
// where ever you set up the Pretender Server

  var server = new Pretender(function () {
    this.post('/write-coverage', this.passthrough);
  });
```

## Advanced customization

### `forceModulesToBeLoaded`

The `forceModulesToBeLoaded` function can potentially cause unintended side effects when executed. You can pass custom filter fuctions that allow
you to specify which modules will be force loaded or not:

```js
QUnit.done(async () => {
  // type will be either webpack and/or require
  forceModulesToBeLoaded((type, moduleName) => { return true; });
  await sendCoverage();
});
```

### `modifyAssetLocation`

Under the hood, `ember-cli-code-coverage` attempts to "de-namespacify" paths into their real on disk location inside of
`project.root` (ie give a namespaced path like lib/inrepo/components/foo.js would live in lib/inrepo/addon/components/foo.js). It makes
some assumptions (where files live in in-repo addons vs app code for example) and sometimes those assumptions might not hold. Passing a
function `modifyAssetLocation` in your [configuration file](#configuration) will allow you to override where a file actually lives inside
of your project. The returned string should be relative to your project root.

```js
module.exports = {
  modifyAssetLocation(root, relativePath) {
    let appPath = relativePath.replace('my-project-name', 'app');

    // here is an example of saying that `app/components/foo.js` actually
    // lives in `lib/inrepo/app/components/foo.js` on disk.
    if (fs.existsSync(path.join(root, 'lib', 'inrepo', appPath))) {
      return path.join('lib', 'inrepo', appPath);
    }

    return false;
  },
};
```

## Inspiration

This addon was inspired by [`ember-cli-blanket`](https://github.com/sglanzer/ember-cli-blanket).
The primary differences are that this addon uses Istanbul rather than Blanket for coverage and it instruments your application code as part of the build, when enabled.
